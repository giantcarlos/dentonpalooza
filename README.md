# **Dentonpalooza 2024**

This is a freelance front-end project and the official website of Denton's Dentonpalooza Festival. The year 2024 was specifically a fundraising year for Leukemia Texas, The Art Room, and The Denton Music and Arts Collaborative.

This project was my first experience utilizing Vite as a build tool, Framer Motion for animations, and Lenis for smooth scrolling.
